 Stuning even for the non-gamer: This sound track was beautiful! It paints the senery in your mind so well I would recomend it even to people who hate video game music! I have played the game Chrono Cross but out of all of the games I have ever played it has the best music! It backs away from crude keyboarding and takes a fresher step with grate guitars and soulful orchestras. It would impress anyone who cares to listen! ^_^,__label__2 
" The best soundtrack ever to anything.: I'm reading a lot of reviews saying that this is the best 'game soundtrack' and I figured that I'd write a review to disagree a bit. This in my opinino is Yasunori Mitsuda's ultimate masterpiece. The music is timeless and I'm been listening to it for years now and its beauty simply refuses to fade.The price tag on this is pretty staggering I must say, but if you are going to buy any cd for this much money, this is the only one that I feel would be worth every penny.",__label__2 
" Amazing!: This soundtrack is my favorite music of all time, hands down. The intense sadness of ""Prisoners of Fate"" (which means all the more if you've played the game) and the hope in ""A Distant Promise"" and ""Girl who Stole the Star"" have been an important inspiration to me personally throughout my teen years. The higher energy tracks like ""Chrono Cross ~ Time's Scar~"", ""Time of the Dreamwatch"", and ""Chronomantique"" (indefinably remeniscent of Chrono Trigger) are all absolutely superb as well.This soundtrack is amazing music, probably the best of this composer's work (I haven't heard the Xenogears soundtrack, so I can't say for sure), and even if you've never played the game, it would be worth twice the price to buy it.I wish I could give it 6 stars.",__label__2 
" Excellent Soundtrack: I truly like this soundtrack and I enjoy video game music. I have played this game and most of the music on here I enjoy and it's truly relaxing and peaceful.On disk one. my favorites are Scars Of Time, Between Life and Death, Forest Of Illusion, Fortress of Ancient Dragons, Lost Fragment, and Drowned Valley.Disk Two: The Draggons, Galdorb - Home, Chronomantique, Prisoners of Fate, Gale, and my girlfriend likes ZelbessDisk Three: The best of the three. Garden Of God, Chronopolis, Fates, Jellyfish sea, Burning Orphange, Dragon's Prayer, Tower Of Stars, Dragon God, and Radical Dreamers - Unstealable Jewel.Overall, this is a excellent soundtrack and should be brought by those that like video game music.Xander Cross",__label__2 
" Remember, Pull Your Jaw Off The Floor After Hearing it: If you've played the game, you know how divine the music is! Every single song tells a story of the game, it's that good! The greatest songs are without a doubt, Chrono Cross: Time's Scar, Magical Dreamers: The Wind, The Stars, and the Sea and Radical Dreamers: Unstolen Jewel. (Translation varies) This music is perfect if you ask me, the best it can be. Yasunori Mitsuda just poured his heart on and wrote it down on paper.",__label__2 
" an absolute masterpiece: I am quite sure any of you actually taking the time to read this have played the game at least once, and heard at least a few of the tracks here. And whether you were aware of it or not, Mitsuda's music contributed greatly to the mood of every single minute of the whole game.Composed of 3 CDs and quite a few songs (I haven't an exact count), all of which are heart-rendering and impressively remarkable, this soundtrack is one I assure you you will not forget. It has everything for every listener -- from fast-paced and energetic (Dancing the Tokage or Termina Home), to slower and more haunting (Dragon God), to purely beautifully composed (Time's Scar), to even some fantastic vocals (Radical Dreamers).This is one of the best videogame soundtracks out there, and surely Mitsuda's best ever. ^_^",__label__2 
" Buyer beware: This is a self-published book, and if you want to know why--read a few paragraphs! Those 5 star reviews must have been written by Ms. Haddon's family and friends--or perhaps, by herself! I can't imagine anyone reading the whole thing--I spent an evening with the book and a friend and we were in hysterics reading bits and pieces of it to one another. It is most definitely bad enough to be entered into some kind of a ""worst book"" contest. I can't believe Amazon even sells this kind of thing. Maybe I can offer them my 8th grade term paper on ""To Kill a Mockingbird""--a book I am quite sure Ms. Haddon never heard of. Anyway, unless you are in a mood to send a book to someone as a joke---stay far, far away from this one!",__label__1 
" Glorious story: I loved Whisper of the wicked saints. The story was amazing and I was pleasantly surprised at the changes in the book. I am not normaly someone who is into romance novels, but the world was raving about this book and so I bought it. I loved it !! This is a brilliant story because it is so true. This book was so wonderful that I have told all of my friends to read it. It is not a typical romance, it is so much more. Not reading this book is a crime, becuase you are missing out on a heart warming story.",__label__2 
" A FIVE STAR BOOK: I just finished reading Whisper of the Wicked saints. I fell in love with the caracters. I expected an average romance read, but instead I found one of my favorite books of all time. Just when I thought I could predict the outcome I was shocked ! The writting was so descriptive that my heart broke when Julia's did and I felt as if I was there with them instead of just a distant reader. If you are a lover of romance novels then this is a must read. Don't let the cover fool you this book is spectacular!",__label__2 
" Whispers of the Wicked Saints: This was a easy to read book that made me want to keep reading on and on, not easy to put down.It left me wanting to read the follow on, which I hope is coming soon. I used to read a lot but have gotten away from it. This book made me want to read again. Very enjoyable.",__label__2 
" The Worst!: A complete waste of time. Typographical errors, poor grammar, and a totally pathetic plot add up to absolutely nothing. I'm embarrassed for this author and very disappointed I actually paid for this book.",__label__1 
" Great book: This was a great book,I just could not put it down,and could not read it fast enough. Boy what a book the twist and turns in this just keeps you guessing and wanting to know what is going to happen next. This book makes you fall in love and can heat you up,it can also make you so angery. this book can make you go throu several of your emotions. This is a quick read romance. It is something that you will want to end your day off with if you read at night.",__label__2 
" Great Read: I thought this book was brilliant, but yet realistic. It showed me that to error is human. I loved the fact that this writer showed the loving side of God and not the revengeful side of him. I loved how it twisted and turned and I could not put it down. I also loved The glass castle.",__label__2 
" Oh please: I guess you have to be a romance novel lover for this one, and not a very discerning one. All others beware! It is absolute drivel. I figured I was in trouble when a typo is prominently featured on the back cover, but the first page of the book removed all doubt. Wait - maybe I'm missing the point. A quick re-read of the beginning now makes it clear. This has to be an intentional churning of over-heated prose for satiric purposes. Phew, so glad I didn't waste $10.95 after all.",__label__1 
" Awful beyond belief!: I feel I have to write to keep others from wasting their money. This book seems to have been written by a 7th grader with poor grammatical skills for her age! As another reviewer points out, there is a misspelling on the cover, and I believe there is at least one per chapter. For example, it was mentioned twice that she had a ""lean"" on her house. I was so distracted by the poor writing and weak plot, that I decided to read with a pencil in hand to mark all of the horrible grammar and spelling. Please don't waste your money. I too, believe that the good reviews must have been written by the author's relatives. I will not put much faith in the reviews from now on!",__label__1 
" Don't try to fool us with fake reviews.: It's glaringly obvious that all of the glowing reviews have been written by the same person, perhaps the author herself. They all have the same misspellings and poor sentence structure that is featured in the book. Who made Veronica Haddon think she is an author?",__label__1 
" A romantic zen baseball comedy: When you hear folks say that they don't make 'em like that anymore, they might be talking about ""BY THE SEA"". This is a very cool story about a young Cuban girl searching for idenity who stumbles into a coastal resort kitchen gig with a zen motorcycle maintenance man, three hysterical Italian chefs and a Latino fireballing right handed pitcher who plays on the team sponsored by the resort's owner. As is often the case she 'finds' herself through honest, often comical but always emotional, interaction with this sizzling roster of players. With the perfect mix of special effects, that salsa sound and flashbacks, BY THE SEA, gets 4 BIG stars from me!",__label__2 
" Fashionable Compression Stockings!: After I had a DVT my doctor required me to wear compression stockings. I wore ugly white TED hose and yucky thick brown stockings. Then I found Jobst UltraSheer. They gave me the compression I needed (15-20,) but looked like regular pantyhose. Even though my blood clot has been gone for 4 years, I still buy these to wear as support stockings because they make my legs feel so nice.**Note, I have problems with the rubberized tops rolling down my thigh. I tried the Jobst adhesive, but I hated having my skin pulled all day. I bought an inexpensive garter belt and it works fine and helps keep the stockings from rolling.",__label__2 
" Jobst UltraSheer Thigh High: Excellent product. However, they are very difficult to get on for older people. I feel like I've had a full day workout after getting them on. Also, as the day wears on, they begin to roll down from the top and create a very deep ridge in the skin. I have to wear them, so if those two difficulties could be addressed it would be such a help.",__label__2 
 sizes recomended in the size chart are not real: sizes are much smaller than what is recomended in the chart. I tried to put it and sheer it!. I guess you should not buy this item in the internet..it is better to go to the store and check it,__label__1 
" mens ultrasheer: This model may be ok for sedentary types, but I'm active and get around alot in my job - consistently found these stockings rolled up down by my ankles! Not Good!! Solution: go with the standard compression stocking, 20-30, stock #114622. Excellent support, stays up and gives me what I need. Both pair of these also tore as I struggled to pull them up all the time. Good riddance/bad investment!",__label__1 
" Delicious cookie mix: I thought it was funny that I bought this product without knowing it was a mix. I read the header very quickly and just thought it was packaged cookies. But no, it is cookie MIX and I guess I should have noticed that since it is right in the title.This is the first time I have ever tried baking with a cookie mix. If you are used to the convenience of the cookie dough that you buy wrapped up in plastic logs then you might be in for a bit of a surprise. Mixing up the dough can get VERY messy (it is extremely sticky). However, with a cookie mix like this you have a lot of flexibility in the ratio of ingredients (I like to add some extra butter to make the baked cookies more chewy). Also, this mix has really large chocolate chips in it--I love that.I removed a star for the addition of 'natural flavors' in the mix.",__label__2 
" Another Abysmal Digital Copy: Rather than scratches and insect droppings, this one has random pixelations combined with muddy light and vague image resolution. Probably the cue should have been the packaging is straight out of your street corner bootleg dealer.If you've ever seen a reasonably good condition film copy, you know the defining visuals of his film are the crystal clear lighting contrasts in black and white. The surrounding countryside and 'old home' scenes are set with early morning ground mists or the haze of memory while the events on the bridge and in the water are bright, clear, and immediate.Here everything is dull, dark, and clouded. Or, if you remember the timbre and enunciation of Captain's commands, so are the visuals.After that, it is hard to believe this award winning, critically acclaimed film's best presentation is on YOUTUBE. Somewhere ""out there"" is a DVD that comes up to the standard of a 16mm public library reel.Just none of them appear to be on Amazon.",__label__1 
" A fascinating insight into the life of modern Japanese teens: I thoroughly enjoyed Rising Sons and Daughters. I don't know of any other book that looks at Japanese society from the point of view of its young people poised as they are between their parents' age-old Japanese culture of restraint and obedience to the will of the community, and their peers' adulation of Western culture. True to form, the ""New Young"" of Japan seem to be creating an ""international"" blend, as the Ando family demonstrates in this beautifully written book of vignettes of the private lives of members of this family. Steven Wardell is clearly a talented young author, adopted for some of his schooling into this family of four teens, and thus able to view family life in Japan from the inside out. A great read!",__label__2 
" i liked this album more then i thought i would: I heard a song or two and thought same o same o,but when i listened to songs like ""blue angel"",""lanna"" and 'mama"" the hair just rose off my neck.Roy is trully an amazing singer with a talent you don't find much now days.",__label__2 
" Problem with charging smaller AAAs: I have had the charger for more than two years. It charges AA batteries just fine, but has a huge problem securing smaller AAA batteries. To charge the smaller batteries you need to flip down the little button at the positive end. In the beginning one of the four AAA batteries would pop up, and now three out of the four won't hold. The problem is the flip mechanism became loose, and any horizontal pressure would push the buttons back up. What I have to do now is using duct tape and a segment of crayon, apply the crayon on the buttons, and wrap the tape around. You know how painful that is.",__label__1 
" Works, but not as advertised: I bought one of these chargers..the instructions say the lights stay on while the battery charges...true. The instructions doNT say the lights turn off when its done. Which is also true. 24 hours of charging and the lights stay on. I returned it thinking I had a bad unit.The new one did the same thing. I just kept it since it does charge...but the lights are useless since they seem to always stay on. It's a ""backup"" charger for when I manage to drain all my AAs but I wouldn't want this as my only charger.",__label__1 
" Disappointed: I read the reviews,made my purchase and was very disappointed. The charger is convenient by charging all four batteries at once but the charge only lasts a very short time. I now have to go and find batteries that will give me longer life than the kodak NiMH AA batteries.",__label__1 
" Oh dear: I was excited to find a book ostensibly about Muslim feminism, but this volume did not live up to the expectations.One essay, among other things, describes the veil as potentially liberating. It doesn't begin to explain how or why.Another, on Muslim women in Cape Town, claims that Muslim women there are separate but ""more than equal."" Gee whiz, what a disappointment.I had expected and hoped for at least one Muslim feminist condemnation of gender apartheid. But there is not a single one in the book.I'm surprised it didn't have an essay extolling the virtues of female genital mutilation.--Alyssa A. Lappen",__label__1 
" Based on the reviews here I bought one and I'm glad I did!: This VCR/DVD was an early Christmas present to myself after deciding to join the rest of the world in DVD-land but not wanting to let go of my VHS movies quite yet. Based on the reviews and price, and because I own a JVC TV, this was my choice. I agree with the easy set-up. It's a bit awkward to work the whole TV/VHS/DVD selection options but I think I've gotten the hang of it.Two comments: it's not intuitive and actually is pretty complicated (too many buttons on the remote but that might please others who are more technically-minded than me) so I've had to rely heavily on the how-to manual. And setting the VCR timer is awkward -- you can't enter the start and end time but have to scroll (unless I'm missing something)...but those are my only complaints. This is a good product for your $$$.",__label__2 
" Incorrect disc!: I am a big JVC fan, but I do not like this model, I was suspiscious when I saw several units in the return section of the store. I bought one anyway (new) and must say I am not happy. The unit sends out clicks to the receiver once in a while, the transition between scenes is not always smooth,(like a little pause) and while it is still fairly new I can't get any DVD,CD or even a DVD headcleaner to work. All I get is a ""incorrect disc"" message.",__label__1 
" happy with it...but: I'm a JVC nut...I have 3 JVC televisions, one VCR, one bookshelf audio system and car audio system. So when it came time to move the VCR player to the boys room and get another one for the old man I knew what make it was going to be. I decided on the combo player because I don't think VHS is going to be around much longer. I like my combo player except for 2 things:(1)no cable box compatability on the remote control (2)no seperate audio video inputs only input for coax cable from my cable box so all of the cable programming is in mono...wife can't tell the difference in the sound so if she's happy then I'll just live with it. VCR and DVD look and sound GREAT!!!!!!!",__label__2 
" should be titled ""Hollywood Debacle"": The plot is so ridiculous, I have to wonder if they even read the script before making this film.

" Is this great TV??? You bet it is: Hotel Babylon is not just good TV...it's great TV!!!! The show features some incredible acting from Tamzin Outhwaite (formerly of EastEnders, a BBC soap) and Max Beesley (from the ill-fated movie ""Glitter"" starring Mariah Carey). The show could make for a great drama series, but I felt that it is a mix of a drama, comedy, and soap opera all mixed into a great BBC show. The show aired on BBC America for a while but didn't get around to seeing it. I can now say that I got the DVD set and all the episodes are great. The season finale was an interesting to watch.The show reminds me of Hotel which aired on ABC from 1983 to 1988. The reason...Hotel was set at a fictional San Francisco hotel as Hotel Babylon was set at a luxury five-star hotel in England.I recommend this DVD to anyone who is willing to watch a great show from the BBC.",__label__2

I believe if I played this CD at a party anywhere in my neighborhood I would get laughed off the beach. Growing up a surfer in San Diego, I would not recommend this CD to any of my Southern California brothers. Honestly, when I played it I kinda of felt I was in a bad B movie.

" Cannot recommend: As a former Alaskan, I didn't want to have to do this. But after repeatedly attempting Allman's recipes and having to throw out 8-10 cups of flour and miscellaneous ingredients nearly every time--and then comparing to Ed Wood's recipes which work flawlessly, and Lisa Rayner's very excellent Wild Bread: Hand-baked sourdough artisan breads in your own kitchen, I can't help but notice that their recipes work, where Allman's fail.I'm not a novice baker. The only thing that worked reliably was the pancakes recipe, but that can be found other places as well.If you are looking for reliable recipes and concise information about starting a sourdough and maintaining it, I recommend any of Ed Wood's books, even his very old ones. Lisa Rayner has written a fabulous tome in Wild Bread. But pass on this book.While some of the historical vignettes were interesting--not enough so to warrant the cost of the book.

The picture quality wasn't all that great and the screen got a horizontal line thru the middle after a short time that would not go away. Plus one of the other reviewers was dead on about the remote - the layout makes no sense at all! Very poor human engineering, IMO. I brought it back to the store for a refund.

My only complaint is that in DVD mode, the sound isn't loud enough. I have it in my RV and with the A/C running, I can barely hear it. I solved the problem by running an audio out jack from the TV to the input on the RV stereo speaker system. It's very lightweight and easy to move around and store. A bonus for the RV. The remote isn't great, but it works just fine and the video/audio jacks and antenna input are easy to get to as is the DVD player. All in all, it's a great deal for the price.",__label__2

Order your normal shoe size, they will be just right with medium weight socks. I won't wear these around the house, running shoes are more comfortable. These will be for hiking, their intended purpose, which they do well. These were the best value that I could find anywhere.",__label__2 
" quality hiking boots in good price!: I found this boot very light and comfortable plus the fact that it's waterproof. it fits perfect in my size, it's warm and breathable too. I liked the colour very much and I was very pleased to find the product in such a good price, compared with other hiking boots that they are not waterproof at all. So far I haven't had the chance to try my boot in a heavy terrain like mud or snow but I believe that they are made for such surfaces.",__label__2 
" Warm & Comfy: These boots are some of the most comfortable that I've ever worn. Even after being on my feet for more than 6 hours my feet felt good. The boots are very warm which is kind of a draw back since I live in Las Vegas. However, after a day of work I was pleasantly surprised to find my socks were still dry. These would probably be best suited for cold climate hiking, but they work pretty good in the desert. Well worth the money.",__label__2 
 Great boot. Light but rugged.: This boot is well constructed for a light weight boot. I experienced minimum break in time with no hot spots. Good support and quite comfortable. I have not hiked in wet conditions so I cannot speak to the water proof feature. The boot runs true to size. I would buy another pair if these were damaged or lost.,__label__2 
" BEST SHOES EVER: I WORK IN A MEAT DEPARTMENT,AND MY FEET WERE ALWAYS COLD AND WET.I ORDERED THESE BOOTS AND I PLAN ON GETTING A FEW MORE PAIRS.THEY KEEP MY FEET WARM WHILE BEING VERY COMFORTABLE AND DRY..TOOK A WHILE TO GET THEM BUT THEY ARE WORTH IT",__label__2 
" Right Boot Defective: The right boot sole was defective, had like a ridge on the outer edge making boot very uncomfortable to walk in. Return and refund procedure was painless. This was the second pair of these boots that had defective sole.",__label__1 
" Great boots for the price: I bought these boots because my $40 Wal*Mart boots were not getting the job done. These provide excellent support and are very comfortable. I bought them 1/2 size large and they fit perfectly. Don't get these boots if you are going to be working in the cold a lot; they breathe well and are great for cool to hot weather, but it does not take long for your feet to get cold on a day that never gets out of the 30s.",__label__2 
" Great purchase: Purchased these boots on Amazon two weeks ago. They were delivered in about 3 days and the fit was perfect. I have found them to be lightweight and very comfortable. And most important to me, since we get lots of snow, the boots keep my feet warm and dry. These boots delivered!",__label__2 
" A really good pair of shoes: These are really good shoes. Great look. Good comfort. No break-in. Very sturdily built. Good price. True to size. The only thing is that, for me, these may not be for general wear. They don't breathe at all (since they are waterproof) and can get a little sweaty and uncomfortable if you are indoors for a while. Driving with these shoes has been a little difficult because there is less leeway for the ankle to move, or rather, it takes some getting used to. I am thinking I should have really bought the ""Low WP"" version.",__label__2 
" Hi-tec Hiking Boots: Like them. Very lite and comfortable. Dry. I'm a now-and-then day-hiker and had only worn them once in the woods. There was a problem of soreness under the top, inside gromets on both boots. Got a suggestion of re-stringing the top gromets from my daughter-in-law, and it worked when I wore them all day running around locally. Suggest including some alternative stringing techniques in shoe boxes.",__label__2 
" What a great boot!: This is the second pair of Altitude IV boots for me and I can't imagine a better hiking boot for my purposes. I hike hilly, wooded areas daily and wear these boots throughout the year. My previous pair lasted three years and the only problem is the lining of the heel wore out. They are now my work boots.They look good and lace up well. Break in is immediate. I don't walk in rivers, but waterproofing lasted a year before needing treatment. Their lightweight and durability amaze me. The only thing that concerns me is that Hi-Tec might stop making them by the time I need another pair.",__label__2 
" Great Boots!: Bought these boots to replace a pair of New Balance boots at twice the price that didn't hold up. These boots are easily more comfortable and are better built. Even though my current pair are still in great shape, I'm tempted to buy another pair in case they become discontinued.",__label__2 
 Hi Tec Altitude 4 mens boot: Comfortable boots that are indeed water proof and actually do breathe. They seem to work well for the winter wearing anything from cotton socks to solar socks depending on the outside temperatures. It should be noted that they do not have a slip resistance sole so they can be slippery on smooth wet surfaces. I haven't had a chance to use them in warmer weather to see fully how well they breathe. For the price they are a very good buy.,__label__2 
" Yes, they are waterproof!: My work takes me out in bad weather frequently, and I really need a boot that will keep my feet dry. I have suffered through 3 different pairs of ""waterproof"" boots that gave me no protection--you get what you pay for, I guess. Someone suggested I order from L. L. Bean, and I was getting ready to fork up the dough, when I saw these in an e-mail from Amazon. They are not fancy, but they ARE waterproof! And, after an initial breaking-in period, they are quite comfortable. I am thoroughly satisfied with these boots.",__label__2 
" Good backpacking boot - for a while: I tried on several more expensive backpacking boots before settling on this one. I have high arches and this boot fit and felt the best. I've put 70-80 miles of backpacking on the boot, including some hard, heavy miles. So far the boot is holding up fine. And they feel great - like I'm walking on cushions.The only downside so far is the leather has worn more quickly than I expected and the waterproofing seems to be wearing off - even after an additional waterproofing treatment.Update:My left boot stopped being supportive after about 90 miles of mid-weight backpacking (with 30-40 lbs). These boots are probably just not durable enough to rely on for backpacking.",__label__2 
" Hi-Tech: This is an excellent light-medium weight boot. I wanted to find a reasonably priced hiking boot for weekend trips. This boot meets all of my expectations. It is light but sturdy, waterproof but still ""breathes"" and it fits according to the size listed. This is not a heavy boot for large pack trips but should be more than enough for light trips.The seller delivered as promised and gave link for tracking. I would defintiely buy from this seller again.",__label__2 
" Great hiking boots: Pros:- Light weight. I am used to military grade boots and this feels like I am walking bare feet. And it doesn't look it in the pictures- Arrests the ankles and keeps them for twisting- Comfortable soul. 5hr hike over rough terrain easily- Does not oven roast my feetCons:- I would have loved to see some stitching going around the shoe. I know glue has come a long way, but I still don't trust a glue only shoe. So I brought mine in to have it stitched. Sorry Hi-Tec I won't be buying another one in the next 3 yrs.",__label__2 
 Very happy: So far I'm very happy with my boots.They fit well and seem very well constructed.Time wiill tell how they perform but so far so good.,__label__2 
" Hi-Tec Men's Altitude IV Hiking Boot: Delivery time was excellent. The comments others have made about the boot running narrow are correct. I ordered a wide but while the boot fits ok it does feel tight in the width. The first couple of times I wore it on short hikes it was comfortable, but on a 3 hour hike it rubbed off the skin on the side of my left heel. Also, the boots have a very stiff sole. However, walking in wet snow the boot remained perfectly dry. I'm new to hiking so perhaps this is normal, but the boot leaves something to be desired as far as foot comfort goes.",__label__2 
 reboot: Great boots. Never had better. Hold up well and definitely keep the water out. Nice and warm in the New England winters. Highly recommend these boots.,__label__2 
" Hi-Tec Boots Altitude IV: This is my 2nd pair. This pair was stiff and needed some break in, but feel great now.Would recommend",__label__2 
" Excellent boot: This is the boot I've been buying for general purpose for 10 years. An excellent boot - wide enough for my wide feet - fit well right out of the box - leather is tough enough to last many years and out sole is very close to being a 'mountain' out sole. Good support, good shank, good cushion. this my boot of choice of work and light hiking.",__label__2 
" Excellent Mid-range Boot!: I just now purchased on Amazon my third pair of Hi-Tec Men's Altitude IV Boots (over the course of 10 years). I live in Minnesota and have found these boots to be excellent in all types of weather, year-around. In addition to wearing these boots every workday on my warehouse job, I do a lot of weekend hiking, camping and exploring of the North Woods and have never been disappointed with these boot's performance. When worn (and sized) for a good pair of extra cushioned wool socks (I buy Smartwool Trekkers Series), these boots are warm enough for shoveling snow and are also comfortable and cool enough for summer wear. It is a perfect light, all around utility boot and I highly recommend them. They are the only boots I have ever literally worn out (they never failed due to workmanship or materials). I just replace the shoestrings with a good quality boot lace and they ""keep on running""!!",__label__2 
" Excelentes botas.. excelentes boots: Excelente producto, quedo muy satisfecho con el producto y con Amazon, por la puntualidad en la entrega,la calidad del producto, zapatos muy comodos, resistentes. Excelente muy recomendable.",__label__2 
" Big Improvement After 30 Years!: I only buy boots every thirty years. These are lighter and better feeling than the heavy clod-hoppers they replaced. My only complaint so far (I've only worn them once to date) is that the bow-part of the laces tends to slip behind the tongue of the boot, coming to rest on my socks.",__label__2 
" 14 YEARS OF LOVING THIS STYLE: My husband loves the look, fit, comfort, and durability of these boots. He has been wearing the Hi-Tec Altitude IV in Dark Brown for at least 14 years. He enjoys working outside and gives these boots a run for their money. The waterproofing works great. A pair of these last him at least a year. The dark brown doesn't show the wear and the boots generally still look ok when he throws them away, but he actually wears out the padding in the soles. I order these boots at least three pairs at a time, because I'm scared they will stop making them. I want this boot that he loves to remain popular and not be discontinued.",__label__2 
 Hi-Tec Boots Work for Me: Had an older pair that lasted for about 6 years. I loved them and sought to replace them with the same model. I got them and they broke in pretty quick. I am happy!,__label__2 
 Great Boot: These Hi-Tec Boots are excellent and very good quality.I use them while I am a rural carrier. they are a great work boot.I recomend to all. Peter.,__label__2 
 not good: 3 months with them and my left boot it open in half i think the glue they use is not good i mean 70 bucks for 3 months is not worth it,__label__1 
 Cheap Boots: Oversize and they pinch my legs. I had to trim the top 1/2 inch off the boots to keep my legs from bleeding they hurt so bad. Cheap Crap but a notch better than Walmart boots.,__label__1 
" VERY NARROW: This pair of boots are too tight and between sizes is big jump,i don't know if there is any other way I can stretch them a bit,they are also only made for soft soil , asphalt concrete will finish them too fast",__label__1 
" hiking boot: We bought these for my husband. He has a rough time with shoes of any kind. These needed some time to be broke in but beyond that are very good. Good price - good value for the money, we think.",__label__2 
" Horrible: Don't know what all the people who gave these boots a great review were thinking but these are not great boots. They did arrive on time but they are not worth the saved money. First off the boots had spots around the lower edge(where the boot and the rubber bottom meet) where there were huge holes where there was missing glue. Tried them on anyway and took them off within 2 minutes off walking around my house. They were the most uncomfortable boots I have ever tired on. They were so bad my feet and ankles hurt for an hour afterwards. The ""insole"" they put in the shoe is a joke at best. It feels like you are walking on a piece of granite. Would not recommend for anyone looking for any boot that they want to actually wear.",__label__1 
 Not As durable as i hoped: Lasted about as long as a pair of boots from wally world for half the price. I live a on a small farm and I do some welding and construction. I guess for a city slicker they will last a life time.,__label__1 
 Good: This product arrived on time and in excellent condition. These boots have a good arch and seem sturdy. They do look a little cheaper than I anticipated. The tread is great. Size runs true.,__label__2

 Hi-Tec are the best shoes: This is my second pair. First pair I wore until the soles were paper thin. Still use them about the yard. Second pair was deliverd quick. Fantastic waterproof feature and comfortable. I occasionally spray shoes to keep them in top notch condition. I high recommend these boots. They are perfect also for hikes as I have wore mine on the AT everytime I visit.,__label__2

" Heavy and Stiff: I'd ordered these boots based on decent reviews and price. I rarely return purchases to Amazon but I did return these. The boots were fairly heavy, stiff and narrow. I get that new boots will be stiff but both the uppers and lowers were too stiff for me. I returned them and bought Adidas boots with Gore Tex uppers which were much more comfortable, flexible and light with good sole traction.",__label__1

This is well beneath the normal standards of his sponsor, The Cato Institute, which usually holds to an exceptionally high standard.I much prefer the similar but far more intelligent and respectful works of Warren Brookes and Julian Simon. They were so good they didn't require ""attitude."" In contrast this author is frequently on TV, the perfect medium for the condescending sneer which is his mien.

" Shows fans are starving for Kate Bush recognition: I am a big fan of Kate Bush. I have collected all of her music, including her cameo appearances on other groups; yet I cannot agree with the other reviewers regarding this CD.The only good thing about this album is that most of the artists did indeed attempt to render original, different versions of Kate Bush's wonderful songs. However, I find their talent a little limited.Listening to this album made me a little sad, as it made me wish that a real tribute album to Kate Bush were released, with versions by artists such as Peter Gabriel, The Cure, Depeche Mode, Morrissey, Annie Lennox, Phil Collins, Tori Amos, etc...The fact that this album was highly rated by other reviewers shows how desperate fans are for more recognition of the talent, uniqueness, and influential nature of Kate Bush's music (especially on some rather popular female artists that followed her).",__label__1 
" What a lovely treat!: Quite frankly, I'm suprised that no one has ever done a Kate Bush tribute album. Given her cult following and ecclectic catalogue, and the number of recording artist who cite Kate as a major influence, it's an project that's more than a little overdue. And Tom Dunning rises gloriously to the occasion. Clearly everyone involved in this album considers this a labor of love, and it makes for a delightful listen.Some of my favorite tracks? ""There Goes a Tenner"" is rendered in trippy-hippy-hoppy-happy fashion - clever and fun. ""Hounds of Love"" is just lovely to listen to, perhaps even better than la Kate's version. Those who chose to cover the B-sides have my devotion, as those are among my own personal favorites. And the tracks I didn't love, well, I didn't love 'em to begin with.Simply put, if you're a fan of Kate, you owe it to yourself to add this to your collection - and if you're trying to introduce any of your friends to la Kate, this album could only aid you in your cause.",__label__2 
" ""Desperately seeking..Kate"": Well at first when I purchased this album I was so full of hope, curiosity and impatience, because I admit I am starving for some new work of Kate Bush--hint, hint)and I know I am not alone on this one. Anyhow, I listened to it again, and again, and I realized that this is unfortunately not it. I really liked the remake of ""Suspended in Gaffa"" that was my favorite, very original (that's why the record is not 1 star), but then I quickly skipped to listen to the classic ""Running up that hill"" and...I cried, I am sorry but the remake was well below average. I agree with another reviewer who expressed the wish of having high profile artists performing Kate's awesome art, I am surprised why they haven't done it so far...However no offense to the artists who did take up on the challenge of performing Kate's songs, more power to them, however I wish they came up with something better.",__label__1 
" An Excellent Look Into What Motivates Students Of Ballet.: This is a very new ballet documentary with many interviews of students and parents on the joys and sacrifices of dancing ballet. There are many fine scenes of dance routines and the technical proficiency of these dancers is very impressive, indeed. Such is the state of ballet in the 21st century! Several aspects are covered, such as training, family support(or the lack of it), competition, injuries, and eating disorders. This is certainly long enough(almost two hours), but my only criticism is that in many of the interviews we see the person seated in a chair for almost the entire segment, instead of having them talk over scenes of dancing. As a ballet dancer myself, when people start to talk about dancing, I want to see dancing while I listen to them(or else I feel the need to get up and dance myself!). There certainly should have been enough of available footage for this. As it is, it is still an excellent, American look at ballet.",__label__2

 Great movie: I think this is a lost David Lean treasure and it is one of Mitchum's finest works. He was a really good actor and I am glad this movie is showing up again and getting good reviews. I think the academa award going to John Mills was a BIG mistake his performance does not hold up over the years. There is a fun book you should get that explains all the complications that went on with the making of this movie that should be included with the DVD,__label__2 
" Great Movies: I had last seen this movie when it came out in 1970. The plot, scenery, acting are as good as it gets. John Mills' performance as Michael earned him a well deserved academy award. He had to spend hours every day just on make-up.As time goes by people pass but their art stays with us forever. Most of the actors in Ryans Daughter are long gone. This movie that was initially not a critical favorite has stood the test of time and is in my top ten along with such movies as Kelly's Heroes, The Graduate and so on. Watching it on VHS format didn't diminish a thing.",__label__2

The openingscene of the Cliffs of Moher was just as beautiful as when I saw it on my trip.

Christopher Jones is still great to look at. Recommend it highly.",__label__2 
" One of my favorite movies of all time.: While this movie was not ""highly acclaimed"" when it was released, back in the late 1960's or early 70's ""I think,"" I have always like it and watch it about once every two or three years. It is the kind of movie that you never get ""fully bored with.""On a scale of 1-5 stars, I give it only four (4) stars, since it is one of those movies that many ""action junkies"" would not like; even-though, it actually has quite a bit of ""lower key action"" and beautiful phototgraphy to support it.My bottom line is: ""If you liked Dr. Zhivago then you will, or should, like Ryan's Daughter.""",__label__2

" Where Is The DVD?: How can such a beautifully filmed movie directed by David Lean not yet be available on DVD? The superior quality of DVD over video tape would lift this film to the level of how it played on the big screen when first released. The storms, the Irish coast and just about every other scene filmed would look so much better on DVD. John Mills gave his finest performance in this movie and won a deserved Oscar.It would be a fitting epitaph to his memory if the film distributors reissued Ryans Daughter in DVD. Nearly all of David Leans other films are available in DVD format. Why not this epic film?",__label__2 
" When oh when!: Each month I scan the ""new"" issues to see if the studio has issued this first rate movie onto DVD but to no avail! when one sees the amount of rubbishy films now being re-issued, it really makes me angry, I guess the reason being the fact that Ryans Daughter was panned in the States, but hay Yanks, how about we Brits? the film was well received over here and is still regulary screened on TV. Freddy Jone's photography should be reason enough but add Sarah Miles, Bob Mitchum, John Mills, where is the problem?",__label__2 
" FOR THE SERIOUS COLLECTOR: Beginning with ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" in 1957, the only David Lean film I would rate less than 5 stars is ""A Passage to India"" and I would give it 4.8. ""Ryan's Daughter"" is simply one of those films that any serious creator of a DVD library should have on his/her top 25 list. It is so spectacular that, for the life of me, I can't imagine what has taken so long for it to arrive in DVD format. As with all his films, Lean's cinematography is truly unequalled, but there isn't a single ingredient with which one can find reasonable fault. ""Ryan's Daughter"" is what filmmaking should always be and so rarely is.",__label__2

" ROMANCE SET IN NORTHERN IRELAND: Ryan's Daughter (Two-Disc Special Edition)David Lean's very interesting romance set in Northern Ireland in 1916. Robert Mitchum is almost type-cast as the sleepy-eyed and plodding village school - master, who marries young Sarah Miles. Christopher Jones is the British Officer who has an affair with Sarah during his stay in the village. But there are only two real stars of the show - the beautiful, sweeping scenery and John Mills, who won a supporting actor Academy Award, for his brilliant, sympathetic portrayal as the hunch - backed village idiot. Production designer, Stephen Grimes, obviously inspired by David Lean's extravagance, creates an entire village to use as the main set. Trevor Howard and Australian, Leo McKern are also very good in their roles.",__label__2

 Good: I originally saw this movie on TV back in the late 1970s. I like the cinematography and of course the acting is superb. However I think the beginning and intermission could have cut out where all you get is about 10-15 minutes of orchestra music with a still picture of Ireland's countryside. Especially at the end of disc 1 where the music goes non-stop and then you realized that the movie continues on disc 2.,__label__2

I saw it originally in the 70s and decided recently to rent it...I wanted to know if it had the same appeal.....if anything, it was far more beautiful than memory served. the scenery is spectacular, the acting suberb! They don't make movies like this anymore! Pour yourself a nice glass of wine and settle down to a very entertaining movie.",__label__2 
" Lean Pickin's: Beautifully photographed but over-produced historical women's picture on an epic scale. Yes, it has its fans but so do those dime-a-dozen bodice-ripper romance novels on supermarket racks. Still, gorgeous cinematography and a lusher-than-lush musical score can't disguise the fact that this David Lean misfire is an overblown snooze of elephantine proportions. A pallid Sarah Miles manages to suggest what Julie Christie might have done with this part, horribly miscast Robert Mitchum plays a flower-pressing milquetoast and a dazed-looking Christopher Jones is so bad his voice had to be dubbed. However, John Mills received richly-deserved Oscar for his portrayal of village idiot struck dumb by plot inanities he witnesses in mute silence. No wonder he's speechless.",__label__1

I looked into eBay and even used camcorders. When I read all the good reviews about this product, I thought I'll give it a shot.With the first use, our family fell in love with it. For the price, you can't beat this deal. The picture quality is a whole lot better than what I expected. This is my 4th Samsung purchase and everyone so far has been a very positive experience. I wish this camcorder has some ""advanced features"" like USB connectivity so that I can download movie clips to a computer. But then again, I didn't have the extra [money] to spend. In couple years, I plan to buy a digital camcorder but for now this will suffice.Bottom line:For 1st time buyers, this is a good start. It's not the best camcorder but definately a good one. It's worth the money.",__label__2 
" Good for begginers: I was looking for a good camcorder for beginers. This one is perfect. It is not the best camcorder, but a very good one. I gave it 5 stars because the price is cheaper than it should be.It is worth much more than it is.",__label__2 
" Not worth it!: This camera semed ok at first... but less than a month after I bought it, the eyepiece viewfinder broke and only displayed a white screen. In bright light (like outside) the entire screen is unfocused and a light object being filmed ends up looking like you filmed the sun, it does not filter the light very well. The battery lasts for about and hour and fifteen minutes when the viewfinder is open; this is not so great when you are out and about and cannot re-charge.This camcorder is the lower class model for Samsung, overall I thought it to be cheap and a waste of money. For only a few dollars more you could get a reliable Sony.The camera did have a few pros though, the mirror, negative, mosaic and art effects on the DSE button were fun, but not worth the hassle the camera gives overall. My advice: DON'T buy IT!",__label__1 
 Malfunction after short time: The camcorder worked only a couple of times.Then the playback picture was totally .......,__label__1 
" Awkward controls, below-par reliability: Like Korean cars, this Korean camcorder does what it says, but it's not something you'll be proud to own. The controls are awkward... even Sony's compact minidv camcorders have better buttons. The video quality is sub par, and my unit, which I received as a factory-sealed gift, broke after about 6 months, a first for all the Asian electronics I have owned. For a little bit more money, you can buy much better camcorders from Japanese manufacturers.",__label__1 
" This is definitely a ""MUST HAVE"" in your collection...: Two things alone on this album from Jason Robert Brown are all you need to be satisfied with the purchase.1) Track #3- ""Someone to Fall Back On"" is one of my all-time favorites of his. It has such a catchy, but soothing, melody line that can't be passed over.2) Lilias White bustin' it out once again on ""Coming Together"" -- adding a glorious rich sound that fans of her will love to play again and again.Few composers/storytellers can tap in to emotion with such satisfying melodies as this gifted musician. Anything he records will gladly be added to my iTunes b/c I can't get enough. Truly wonderful.",__label__2 
" You MUST buy everything by Jason Robert Brown!!!: So hello. This is Grant, a performer and music lover. I've followed Jason's music from the big stuff that everyone knows to the little shows like Urban Cowboy in Coconut Grove that not everyone got to see. This CD is a MUST have. Jason's excellence and genius shines through with such variety in this newly released CD. His adaptability is shown best in Parade, and his fantastic ability to write songs for starving singers comes through in The Last Five Years and Songs For A New World, but if you just want a great CD to listen to with fantastic variety and all around genius, this is the CD to get. This would make a great gift for any open music lover. Don't forget to keep up on his new works. He's a busy guy and is often coming out with new original music. Also look out for his new website!",__label__2 
" U need this JRB CD!: This compiliation of songs from gifted, Tony award winning composer Jason Robert Brown is a feast for the ears. For JRB fans, it is a chance to hear his signature style music and witty lyrics up-close and personal, without the constraints of a musical's plot. For newcomers to Mr. Brown's music, you'll get a taste of everything, from the gospel sound of ""Coming Together"" to the big band swing of ""Grow Old With Me"" to the spirited rock/musical sound of ""Getting Out"". My favorite is the ballad ""Someone to Fall Back On"", which he often uses as an encore at his live performances. The energy in the band and vocals captures the feel those live performances . This is a 'must-have' CD!",__label__2 
" Another Aw Inspiring Career Move: Just when you thought JRB couldn't get better he does. The music is greatly appealing to a wide range of listeners. Of course if your a fan you already have it. If you are not familiar there is something for everyone. It isn't the stereotypical musical theatre album. It has a wonderful rock/pop feel with musical theatre sensibility as only JRB can seem to produce.One of my favorites is Over. A tremendous song about a soldier who just died in the desert of some war torn country (just pick one). It is touching, poignant, and somehow even patriotic.So anyway run to get this album because it will be a classic and if you are not into musical theatre it is because you haven't heard it executed like this.",__label__2 
 OK: I really like songs for a new world and the last 5 years. was excited to purchase this disc but was kinda disappointed. lacks the edgy variation and creativity of the others. not bad and the cover track is fun--just not up to the success of the other jason robert brown work.,__label__1 
 excellent resource: I am fortunate enough to have Lake Douglas as an instructor. He has forgotten more about landscape architecture than most people will ever know. I love going to his class because he has a genuine passion for the subject and almost limitless knowledge. Buy this book. You won't be disappointed.,__label__2 
 BRIO Curved Track: BRIO is the most durable and has the best quality wooden train on the market. Another must have for train extending. We have about 10 sets of these. It makes it really easy for our son to build whatever he wants. Another great product.,__label__2 
" really good release of the ORIGINAL 1957 LP!: I think too many people are assuming that they are buying a compilation CD when they pick up this release. In fact, this was the original album released in 1957. Ella gets top billing becuse she was the biggest of the three ""names"" at the time. These sessions were laid down between Jan 4, 1956 and April 30, 1957. Each artist gets a chance to showcase their talents and it is apparent that, when they all get together for the few numbers that they all share, they are really swinging and having a great time. Basie's band was in top form, the arrangements were wonderful and the vocals are spot on. This is a terrific window into the past.",__label__2 
" Great Fidelity 1956 1957 Swing From Basie and Williams.: What we have here is the crack ""April In Paris"" era Basie band with one Ella F track singing with Joe Williams on ""Too Close To Comfort"", a bunch of tracks with Joe taking the lead and a few great swinging instrumentals and a few alternative sides.The whole album works well, great sound,exciting music,especially if you like the croon of Joe Williams.The famous ""Joe Williams sings CD"" with Basie is considered the better,no arguing that fact, but this CD is a nice addition to your library.Great blowing on the 3 versions of One'O'clock Jump here make it all worthwhile.",__label__2 
" Good print quality - bad mechanism: I bought this printer new, when it was HPs top of the line. I have been very disappointed in it from day one.The print quality is fine. The duplexer is a joke. It needs the bottom of the page to grip the paper, so it can not print on that area. The driver software gives you two options to deal with this - print everything at about 90% scale to squeeze the content into the printable space, or re-sort the pages allowing the SW to move the page breaks. Neither is appealing, so I found that I reverted to manual duplex mode - taking the paper out and reversing itself myself.The biggest problem I have with the printer is frequent paper jams. Even when using HP brand multipurpose paper, I find that the printer jams about 25% of the time. In the quest for speed, the paper load mechanism is just too fast, pulling in many sheets of paper instead of just one.",__label__1 
" Lousy: This has to be the most horrible printer in the world. If I could give it -5 stars I would. I just got a new digital camera and of course just got this printer. Now when I print my photos it has blurred lines through it and is all messed up. Its print quality is horrible. It may be a bad printer - but HP is no help at all. They keep saying to install new drivers, when it is clearly a hardware problem. I want to throw this thing away, unfortunatly I got it on clearance and I'm stuck with it. Don't buy this pile of junk.",__label__1 
 Older Craftsman Garage Door Opener.: I have an older Craftsman Garage Door Opener. Had replaced the gears to my garage door opener and it would not work right. Would only move a foot or so and stop. Looked up information about what could possibly be wrong and it suggested that the RPM Sensor Assembly probably needed replaced. Replaced it and it now works like a charm. Was much cheaper then buying a whole new automatic garage door opener.,__label__2 
 Got 'er fixed: This was one of the most simple and cost saving things I have done. instructions were exact and took longer to put cover back on vs. change the part.,__label__2 
 Product Performance: RPM sensor was defective. The lift motor would not stop running with the new circuit board installed.I removed the new circuit board and replaced it with the old one and everything seems to be OK now.The part is so inexpensive it's not worth returning.,__label__1 
 Worked like a charm: My garage door was not working for 4 months.And did some research and bought this product.Right away the garage door started working great.,__label__2 
 RPM Sensor Assembly: Great purchase. I was so frustrated and I couldn't figure out what was causing my garage door to reverse direction after just a few feet. This was an easy fix. Everything was packed well and shipped fast,__label__2 
 Customer service: The item is excellent and that was exspected and it resolved the issue. But the seller is very customer focused. Thanks,__label__2 
" Best Computer Acessory: A year and a half ago, I purchased everything I needed for my first computer. I did a lot of research and went way wrong with highly recommended Dell computer. But, based on what I could see at the store (the clerks at CompUSA are not too eager to help) I bought this printer. It has been the best purchase of my computing experience. Photos are flawless, as is everything else I print with this printer. It seeems to do what it is supposed to and musch more incredibly well.",__label__2 
" Fantastic Photo Printer: This has been a great printer for me. I regularly print both 4x6 and letter size photos. The quality is outstanding, and the automatic paper sensor is a good feature. I had absolutely no problems with set up. The only improvement would be to print borderless.",__label__2 
" Envelope Feeder Never Worked: I have a small business and it was important that the envelope feeder work well. From day 1, this has been a nightmare. Components of the printer block the envelopes/labels and they don't feed properly. If you use internet postage, you lose money with the misfed labels/envelopes. I'm very disappointed and am shopping for a new printer now, only a short time after purchasing this one.",__label__1 
" My mistake: This printer has been a nightmare. First I can not usemy Visioneer scanner. They say it is not compatable.I removed a jammed paper, and since then anything I print,such as invoices, checks and such, come out with blotchedprinting and paper tears. I get NO help from technicalsupport(They're learning). No 800 number, which means youhave to call CA on your buck.I used to swear by HP. Now I am convinced that theirproducts are close to junk. My opinion is STAY AWAY!",__label__1 
" Poor customer support: The printer worked fine for about a year (no borderless prints though). After 15 months it started jamming every single time that I tried to print. I expected a ... repair bill (replace the roller) since the printer is out of warranty. According to HP, no 1215 printer can be repaired. Their only option is an exchange. They will send you a new HP 1215 for [price] (retail is [price]) and you return your old one. Apart from a ... coupon this is the ONLY option. Buyer beware.",__label__1 
" Recipe for grief: Until this product, I was a huge promoter of HP printers, but the HP 1215 apparently was designed with little attention to Apple compatibility. Unpredictably it refused to print first in 0S9 and then in 0SX. I'm frankly sick of downloading and reloading new drivers only to find they don't work and/or freeze up my entire computer. Because of this printer I've cleaned off my entire hard drive, lost valuable files and programs, and still wound up with a non-functional machine. It's been in my closet for 6 months, and I'm considerably happier with a new bottom-of-the-line Canon printer.",__label__1 
" Hate This Printer! Annoying messages to reset it !!!: I had had two HP printers. Both broke in the same places - where the paper shoots out from the printer; the wings or the ""arms"" which guide the paper from the printer - both broke easily.Also I get an annoying message on my computer that the ""yellow box marked !"" is on and therefore I have to exit out of the printer mode and reset the yellow box so that the ! is deleted. Then go back into the printer mode. This is so annoying that I am never getting an HP Printer again.If you look on the instruction book, the annoying message can never to resolved - only by resetting the message yellow ! again, and again!!!!!!!!",__label__1 
" Hp Customer Care! A Joke!: On 04/03/02 I bought a new printer hp photosmart 1215, it installed perfectly, now, suddenly it decided to stop dead!I have contacted Hp Customer Care re the problem....timeout settings...no help availadle...also my PC tells me there are now no drivers for this device installed! How can this be???",__label__1 
" Worth the wait: This album is worth the wait. Great vocals accompanied by rocking fuzzed out riffs. Sounds like the perfect cross between Unida and Kyuss. The cd hasn't left my player yet. The only problem I have (which means 4 stars instead of 5) is that its fairly short. It really only has 7 tracks that total under 30 minutes. That aside, any fan of this genre of music will love it. The cd flat out rocks all the way through.",__label__2 
" Unfortunately Cannot Do ZERO stars: This is not a book. It is nothing more than the postings from an AOL message board that is actually from way back in 1994. What a joke. I don't know who wrote up the ""publisher's review"", but talk about a mislead. Each page is like a separate posting from this ongoing thread and is for the most part very boring. The so called author is simply one of the posters who got involved in the postings at some point. That's it. The so called author tries to constantly instigate controversy, especially with one other poster. Probably for the purpose of creating the controvery of being able to get this book published. Though how he found someone to publish it is beyond me.",__label__1 
" Can't Believe This Was Even Published: Talk about junk. Who would publish somethng like this? I see that it was published by some unheard of publishing company in Lakewood, Ohio? What other garbage have they published? I can find nothing about any other books published by this ""so-called"" publisher. Only some kind of religeous tracts tye stuff. The earlier reviewers have lready hit on the faults of this book. While the book indicates that permission was obtained from AOL to use these postings, how abot all of the individual posters? How many of them simply used a username that was the same as their e-mail address header? And how many of them were embarrassed when friends or family may have stumbled across this and recognized them and their postings. Postings that were assumed to have a certain degree of semi-privacy? Shame on AOL and shame on this so-called author for simply copying months and months of postings and copying them into a manuscript and then somehow getting it published as a ""book"".",__label__1 
" This player deserves more US air time: I fell in love with Brasilian jazz my first trip to Rio. I've been there many times and was always amazed, visiting the little clubs, listening to a lot of great players. I don't remember how I found this guy, but, understanding music 'from the heart', Leo understands, and plays it that way. In my view, he is one of the most sensitive sax players I've ever heard - check out #3 on Black Pearls, you'll see what I mean..... I think it would be a great project for Leo to hook up with Bob James and Fourplay, and let Leo play, I mean feature him, write and produce songs that bring out his talent, give him lots of freedom. I rated this 4 stars, simply because of a couple of songs I skip pver, but all in all, it's great listening. And as a bassplayer, I've spent hours playing along with him.",__label__2 
" The ultimate ""touchy-feely"" book.: This book contains such advise as writing down personal affirmations which you will repeat to yourself at the beginning of each day:I am calm, prepared, and entertaining.I am fit and beautiful.I am humble, patient, and compassionate.I am enough, just the way I am.If this kind of advise is your cup of tea, then this is your kind of book.",__label__1 
" I was better off with Alexandra Stoddard....: Very much like Alexandra Stoddard's books, too much alike. Stoddard's books are less wordy and still get to the point. I stopped reading this book when the similarities became clear, been there done that. If you are looking for something in the ""guidance"" area, try Stoddard. She has many better books. I have some and re-read them often for refreshers and finding the ""gems"" I forgot about.",__label__1 
" too small to read: My rating of one *is not a reflection of the story or the gorgeous illustrations; but, on the unreadable digital version. Shame on the people who will profit from selling something with an unchageable font size that is too small to read. It was obviously scanned in and formatted on landscape view with two hard cover book pages per one narrow digital page. The font and the page size can't be enlarged. I'm really disappointed with Amazon for not only selling something of such inferior quality and even more disappointed with them for highlighting this product as a daily deal. :-(",__label__1 
 A classic favorite.: Paul Galdone captures the story just right with his wording and illustrations. This is a must-have for my grandchildren. You can't go wrong with a Paul Galdone illustrated folktale.,__label__2 
" A short story....: A wonderful story but somewhat short. Take out the illustrations and the total story would be two or three pages long. But I love some of the old tales and I love cats, so this was a must for my library. The Puss In Boots reminds me of the tricksters of Native American tales. Enjoy!",__label__2 
" A well earned Caldecott: Puss in boots is always an enjoyable tale, probably because it is so based on wit.I really enjoyed these illustrations they are glowing and friendly, making one feel very comfortable as they turn the pages. Puss is adorable, the expressions that our fine illustrator manages to convey through his feline features are just fantastic! Time and time again I was always dissapointed when I found a page that the lovely cat was not on.A wonderful additition to any collection of books for children or lover of fairy tales.",__label__2
